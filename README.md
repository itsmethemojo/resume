As a developer i always look for ways to do things intelligent. A while ago i found https://jsonresume.org/ and fell in love with concept. A single source of truth in lovely machine readable json format and multiple ways to export that data in different formats. That's it.

# so here is my Resume

* in [HTML](https://itsmethemojo.github.io/resume/resume.html)
* in [Markdown](https://github.com/itsmethemojo/resume/blob/master/resume.md)
* in [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsmethemojo/resume/master/resume.json)

## and so it is generated
```
task install-buildpack
```

```
task npm-install export-markdown export-html
```
